Hello! This is a new Vault I've opened to keep all my notes together around cosplay.

# TODO
- [ ] Create the following landing pages:
	- [ ] [[Seeds]] - Single lines about characters I could do, with at most a link to a picture of said character
	- [ ] [[Concepts]] - Folder for very early explorations, at most how certain details of characters could be achieved
	- [ ] [[Projects]] - Cosplays I've fully committed to, with a folder for each character.

I'm still trying to work out my full workflow, but generally this is how things got split up when I've done cosplay in the past.
